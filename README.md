Task Manager

Overview

The Task Manager is a web-based application designed for organizing tasks into three categories: To Do, In Progress, and Completed. 
It combines a modern React frontend with a MongoDB backend to provide an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and task management features.

Features

1. Task Management:
Drag-and-drop tasks between To Do and In Progress.
Tasks in the Completed category remain static and cannot be dragged.

2. Task Status Actions:
Use dropdown menus to move tasks between categories directly.

3. Task Addition:
Add new tasks with a name and status using a form.

4. Persistent Storage:
Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database to ensure data is saved.


How to Use It
1. View tasks in To Do, In Progress, and Completed columns.
2. Drag and drop tasks between To Do and In Progress.
3. Use dropdown menus on tasks to quickly update their status.
4. Add new tasks using the form at the top of the page.

Built With
1. React for the frontend.
2. Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend.
3. React Beautiful DnD for drag-and-drop functionality.
